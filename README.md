# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using various classification algorithms with hyperparameter optimization.

## üìã Description

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning solution for the famous Kaggle Titanic survival prediction competition. The project implements multiple classification algorithms with hyperparameter optimization to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and more.

The solution employs a systematic approach:
1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Feature engineering and preprocessing
3. Model training with hyperparameter optimization
4. Model evaluation and selection
5. Prediction generation for test data

## ‚ú® Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset with visualizations to understand feature relationships and survival patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features like family size, title extraction from names, and family survival correlation
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses Hyperopt library to find optimal parameters for each model
- **Multiple Classification Algorithms**:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine (implementation available but not used in main script)
  - Neural Network with Keras (implementation available but not used in main script)
- **Model Comparison**: Automatic selection of the best performing model for final predictions
